# StatisGen

This project's aim is to deliver statistic on the development of static site generators.

I know there are some project like that as http://staticgen.com or
https://staticsitegenerators.net/ but what I dislike most is the default sort by starred
project.

I prefer sort project by total numbers of contributors. I think it is more realist to
measure project activity.

In the future, I want to include more statistics about Git activity.

It is based on Jekyll, you can see it online there : http://lomiglavnek.github.io/
